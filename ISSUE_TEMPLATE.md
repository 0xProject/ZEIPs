This is the suggested template for 0x related issues. 

## Summary ( 2-5 Sentences )
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the issue.

## Motivation
The motivation is critical to change the 0x protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate with respect to the issue raised. It is acceptable to state an issue without offering suggestions if the issue is cleary defined. 

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of the issue. Be it an improvement in computational efficiency or security, try to provide concrete evidence and easily testable cases. If a suggestion is proposed, provide sufficient details so that an implementation would be possible (Proof of Concepts are acceptable). 

## Rationale (if a suggestion is proposed)
The rationale should flesh out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made.

## Notes
Any notes like links or references that help supporting the present claims.
